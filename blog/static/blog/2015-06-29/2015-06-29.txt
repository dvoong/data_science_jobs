Data sources
Googled "biggest employment agencies" and clicked on "http://www.jobsite.co.uk/insider/uks-top-10-recruitment-agencies-celebrated-jobsites-recruitrank-awards-2012-11320/" which has a list of the "top" recruitment agencies determined by the RecruitRank Awards. Don't actually recognise any of these agencies so decided that it wasn't the most relevant for my study which is aimed at less specialised recruiters.
Googled "most popular recruitment sites uk" and clicked on "http://www.bestjobwebsites.co.uk/" which lists the top 10 websites
