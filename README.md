SOC: Standard Occupational Classification. (See exploration notepad for more details). A full list of SOC codes can be found here, https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/303033/CoP_-_Apr_14_V0_6.pdf. The skills information related to a given SOC code is broader than what I'm aiming for with this analysis (e.g. SOC codes list skils such as oral and reading comprehension skills rather than specific languages, tools and specialisations such as pandas, Hadoop and machine learning algorithms), at the moment it is not particularlly relevant.

SAS: Statistical Analysis System

CRM: Customer Relationship Management
